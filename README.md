### Pagefile and Crash Prevention
ReSkyrimed has been optimized for better memory usage, but it still demands a lot of RAM, especially if you're on a 16GB system with background tasks running. If the game can't allocate enough memory, you may experience crashes or instability.

This step isn't mandatory, but it's highly recommended if you have 16GB of RAM or less.

To set up your pagefile:
1. Press `Win + R`  
2. Type `sysdm.cpl` and press `Enter`, or use Windows Search to find `Advanced System Settings`  
3. Go to the `Advanced` tab and click the `Settings` button under the `Performance` section  
4. In the `Performance Options` window, click the `Advanced` tab and then the `Change...` button under the `Virtual Memory` section  
5. Uncheck `Automatically manage paging file size for all drives`  
6. Select your disk drive (recommended: the drive where `ReSkyrimed` is installed)  
7. Under `Custom size:`, set both `Initial size (MB)` and `Maximum size (MB)` to `40960`  
8. Click `Set`  
9. Click `OK`  
10. Restart your computer
